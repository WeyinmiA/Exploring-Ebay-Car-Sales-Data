# Exploring-Ebay-Car-Sales-Data
The aim of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on Ebay car sales data.

In this project we will practice applying a variety of pandas methods to explore and understand the related data set on car listings from Ebay.

The steps involved in this process include an initial exploration of the dataset, followed by some data cleaning and analysis. We will seek to identify any patterns in the associated dataset and make some inferences based on the information at hand.
